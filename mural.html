    <div class=sidecontent><p>The Italian-born artist created the design before coming to St. Catharines but altered it upon arrival to include local faces in the mural. Set against a white backdrop, the mural features three young women, heads down, looking at their phones.</p>

    <p>It’s reflective of a society that is becoming ever-increasingly addicted to technological devices, like their cell phones.</p>

    <p>While artwork adorns the alley, the largest piece created as part of the festival, the annual Graffiti Jam was painted by a Barcelona-based artist known as Jupiterfab. Fulton said he was drawn to the artist and his focus of using art as a tool for social change.</p>



<p>“Instead of talking to each other in person, everyone prefers to talk online or over their phones,” said Jupiterfab, as he worked on a portion of the large wall on Garden Park at St. Paul Street. “They’re standing together, looking at their phones and not the people at their sides.”</p>
